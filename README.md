# About this
Due to the Yucon Framework not supporting Rojo, I decided to create a rojo template that would allow it to work with Rojo through the default.project.json file.

#Disclaimer
I do not own Yucon Framework or Rojo and are not related to any of their development teams. This project is simply for convenience and is not a collaboration or anything related to them.
