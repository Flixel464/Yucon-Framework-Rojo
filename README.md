# About this project
I created this template so that people would be able to use the Yucon Coding framework in conjuction with Rojo so that it would be more convenient for developers. I did this by editing the default.project.json file.

# Disclaimer
I am not related to both Yucon and Rojo's development teams and simply build this project for convenience. If you occur any issues with the products, please contact their developers as I am unable to help you with them.
